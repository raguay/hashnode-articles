## First Release of the New Modal File Manager

I’ve just released the first version of the new Modal File Manager for the macOS. It is built using [Wails 2](https://wails.io/) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). It is a complete universal application that should work on Intel and M1 Macs. I’ve been developing and using it on my M1 MacBook Pro for several weeks now. I use it as my main file manager everyday.

If you have a problem, please leave an [issue](https://github.com/raguay/ModalFileManager/issues) so that I can track it down and fix it. I haven’t built it on a Linux or Windows system. Therefore, I’m not sure how well it will do there. 

You can read the annoucement [here](First release for the Modal File Manager:
https://github.com/raguay/ModalFileManager/discussions/5) and download the program [here](https://github.com/raguay/ModalFileManager/releases/tag/v1.0.2). 

Currently, the only documentation is the GitHub README.md file. You can read it [here](https://github.com/raguay/ModalFileManager). I’ll be working on better documentation soon.

I’m working on another post describing the move from NW.js application to a Wails 2 application. It will be coming soon.

Amendment: If anyone downloaded the last version (1.0.0 - 1.0.1), please download the latest (1.0.2). This release fixes the case of running the program on a system that had never ran the program or the NW.js version of the program before.
